# SurvivingOwl
 A simple 2D game in C++. <br>
Made with sprite animation and QT.<br>
When the owl is hit by a stone, it loses 1 life.<br>
When there are no lives left, owl dies and the app asks user, if he wants to try again.<br>
Stones generation frequency increases over time, making the owl's survival more difficult.<br>
The game has background music that can be turned off.
